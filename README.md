## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Anthony! I'm a master's student in computer science at Georgia Tech, with roots in Taiwan and Silicon Valley, now based in the Bay Area.

- I love building things and solving problems (currently building [**Zentrainer**](https://zentrainer.xyz))
- Developing [**AI virtual teaching assistants**](https://dilab.gatech.edu/jill-watson/) at [**GT's Dilab**](https://dilab.gatech.edu)
- Passionate about AI, educational technology, startups, and fitness
- Software engineering experience at Gusto, Solvvy (Zoom), and Cisco

I'm always excited to tackle new challenges, explore ways to make an impact through technology and make new friends along the way.

Whether it's discussing new ideas, collaborating on projects, or just having a friendly chat, I'm open to talking. Please feel free to reach out and say hi!
